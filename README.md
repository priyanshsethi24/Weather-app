# Weather-app

This Weather App is a responsive front-end project built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to retrieve real-time weather data by simply entering a city name. The app integrates with the OpenWeatherMap API to display key information such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed. Dynamic weather icons change based on current conditions, and user-friendly error handling ensures a seamless experience for invalid city inputs. Designed with a clean and interactive UI, the app is mobile-friendly and offers a smooth search functionality using asynchronous API calls. This project is ideal for demonstrating front-end development and API integration skills.
